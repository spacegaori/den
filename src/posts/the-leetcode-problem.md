I have heard that on one occasion Mukiman was staying in his Den...

I asked Mukiman: 

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'School prestige lands internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'School prestige does not land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'GPA lands internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'GPA does not land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'Connections land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'Connections do not land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'Projects land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'Projects do not land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'Leetcode lands internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

"How is it, Mukiman - does Mukiman hold the view: 'Leetcode does not land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless'"?"

"...no..."

“How is it, Mukiman, when Mukiman is asked if Mukiman holds the view ‘School prestige lands internships…’ … ‘Leetcode does not land internships: only this is true, anything otherwise is worthless,’ Mukiman says ‘ … no…’ in each case. Seeing what drawback, then, is Mukiman thus entirely dissociated from each of these ten positions?”

"Gaori, the position that ‘... lands internships’ is a thicket of views, a wilderness of views, a contortion of views, a writhing of views, a fetter of views. It is accompanied by suffering, distress, despair, & fever, and it does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, self-awakening, unbinding.

“The position that ‘School prestige lands internships’…

“…’School prestige does not internships’…

“…’GPA lands internships…

“…’GPA does not land internships’…

“…’Connections land internships’…

“…’Connections do not land internships’…

“…’Projects land internships’…

“…’Projects do not internships’…

“…’Leetcode lands internships’…

“…’Leetcode does not land internships’… does not lead to disenchantment, dispassion, cessation; to calm, direct knowledge, self-awakening, unbinding.”

“Does Mukiman have any position at all?”
